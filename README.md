# STEP
STEP is a social networking platform that one can use to ask for help when needed or offer help to people in need. This app tries to bring help from nearby people rather than sending an SOS message to relatives or Police who can be miles away when the SOS call is made. With the help of a location tracking system, we can reach the exact location of the needy person. It also offers an offline location tracking system when an internet connection is not available.
